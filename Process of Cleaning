1. Remove Duplicates

	First let's check for duplicates 
	We need to really look at every single row to be accurate        
	creating  CTE with row_num column bacause we want to delete row  where the number is > 1 
	now we can delete dulicate record's where row_num>1

2. Standardize Data
	removing space or unwanted character from rows
	Updating same name for same catagory 
	fromating Date column into proper format 
	assigning same value for null or blank data belongs to same catagory  

3. Look at Null orBlank Values
	in total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off colums has lot's of null values so, we have to delete it  

4. remove any columns and rows we need to
	now have delete row_num column which we don't needed
